// The PreAuthorization Object ensures the solvency of a registered card for 7 days. The overall process is as follows:
//
// Register a card (CardRegistration)
// Create a PreAuthorization with the CardId. This allows you to charge an amount on a card
// Charge the card through the PreAuthorized PayIn object (Payins/preauthorized/direct)
// How does PreAuthorization work?
//
// Once the PreAuthorization object is created the Status is "CREATED" until 3D secure validation.
// If the authorization is successful the status is "SUCCEEDED" if it failed the status is "FAILED".
// Once Status = "SUCCEEDED" and PaymentStatus = "WAITING" you can charge the card.
// The Pay-In amount has to be less than or equal to the amount authorized.
